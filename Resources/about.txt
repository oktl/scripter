This app is for adding songs to my music
database.

I wrote a python script to make it easy to 
create a sql script for the songs. It 
started simple, just get the song data and
then copy and paste it into the DB Browser
app to execute and commit the script.

Along the way I added more things and 
tried different ways to do things.

So I decided to make a gui to simplify some
of those requirements. And that was easy
enough to do. But then I kept thinking of 
ways to make the gui do more. I added
some features, automated checks and
safety mechanisms. But it's not perfect yet.
